    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Idli Sambhar is a popular South Indian dish consisting of soft, steamed rice cakes (idli) paired with a flavorful, tangy lentil soup (sambhar). Idli is made from fermented rice and urad dal (black gram) batter, which is steamed into light, fluffy cakes. It is often served with sambhar, a spicy and aromatic stew made from toor dal (pigeon peas), vegetables, tamarind, and a blend of spices, giving it a unique balance of tangy and spicy flavors.</p>
    <p>This combination is not only delicious but also nutritious, as it provides a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fiber. It is commonly enjoyed for breakfast or as a light meal across India, particularly in southern states.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Prep the Sambar Masala Paste</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a small frying pan at a medium flame. Don't add oil.</li>
        <li>Once the pan becomes hot, add 2 tbsp dried coconut. Roast till the dried coconut becomes slightly golden brown. Then, take off flame and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp chana dal to the pan and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp urad dal and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp coriander ceeds and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp jeera/ cumin seeds and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp black pepper and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp menthya seeds/ Fenugreek seeds and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp sesame seeds and roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 small piece of chakke/ cinnamon bark and 2-3 cloves. Roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Finally, break 3 dried red chilis and add to the pan. Roast for a few more seconds.</li>
        <li>Take everything off flame and transfer to the plate that the coconut is cooling on. Let cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer spices to a small blender/food processor and dry grind to a fine masala powder.</li>
        <li>Then, in the same small frying pan that you roasted the spices, add a drop of oil. Add 1 medium onion (roughly chopped) and roast till the onion becomes golden brown. Transfer to the blender.</li>
        <li>Also add about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 tsp turmeric to the blender. Grind to a wet masala paste. Keep aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the Sambar</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 1/2 cup of toor dal with 3 cups of water in a pressure cooker at a medium flame for 2 whistles.</li>
        <li>After 2 whistles, turn off the flame and release the pressure. Remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Keep the pressure cooker on the stove and heat it up at a medium flame once again.</li>
        <li>If the dal looks too thick, add more water. Let the toor dal come to a slow boil. Then, turn down the flame to a low flame and let it continue to simmer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate frying pan, heat 2 tbsp ghee at a medium flame.</li>
        <li>Add 2 medium yellow onions (thinly sliced) and 1 cup pearl onions. Sauté till the onions are golden brown. Add the browned onions to the boiling toor dal. (Note: onions nicely browned in ghee is crucial for lingering Sambar!)</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add another 2 tbsp ghee.</li>
        <li>Add 2 medium tomatoes (finely chopped). Sauté for a few minutes. The tomatoes should become nice and mushy. Then, add to the boiling toor dal.</li>
        <li>Now, add the masala paste and mix well.</li>
        <li>Finally, add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Let the sambar simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the sambar is done cooking, add 1 tbsp of jaggery. Mix well and take off flame. Enjoy with hot Idlis!</li>
