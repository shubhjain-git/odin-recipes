    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Instant Rava Appe, also known as Poddu and Paniyaram is a delightful South-Indian snack typically served with chai. Appe are golden brown and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and when served with aromatic chutneys on a platter, one just can't have enough of this mouth-watering delicacy.</p1>
    <p2>Appe are traditionally made out of urad and rice batter which is fermented for hours before using it to make Appe in a special pan with moulds called Appam Patra. However, this Instant Rava Appe recipe will let you make this dish in a jiffy and in a hassle-free manner.</p2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup rava/suji/ semolina</li>
        <li>½ cup curd/dahi</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mustard (sarso) oil</li>
        <li>1 green chilli, chopped</li>
        <li>8-10 curry (kadi) leaves</li>
        <li>¼ tsp mustard (sarson) and cumin (jeera) seeds</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1-inch ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp coriander (dhaniya) leaves, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the batter by adding rava (suji/semolina) and curd in a bowl. Whisk the mixture well so that there are no lumps in the batter.</li>
        <li>Next, add water to the batter, mix well and then add salt.</li>
        <li>Then, add baking soda and mix. Keep the batter aside for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a pan add 1 tsp oil, add mustard and cumin seeds when the oil is warm enough. Add green chilies, curry leaves, onion, and ginger.</li>
        <li>Add this to the instant rava appe batter and mix well. Also add coriander leaves and mix.</li>
        <li>Then, in an Appam Patra (Appam patra is a special pan for making appe), add some oil and when the oil is warm, add 1 tbsp of batter.</li>
        <li>Depending on the Appam Patra, be careful while adding the batter as some appam patras or pans might be a little wobbly.</li>
        <li>Cover it and let it cook for 2 minutes on low flame or until the bottom is golden brown. Once the bottom side is golden brown, flip the appe.</li>
        <li>Let the other side of the appe cook for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, serve hot with South-Indian coconut peanut chutney or tomato chutney.</li>
      </ol>
